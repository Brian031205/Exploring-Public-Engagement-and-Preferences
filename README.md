# Exploring Public Engagement and Preferences:
## Trends in Traffic-Calming Support Rates and Ballot Return Rates in Toronto (2015-2023)
## Overview
This paper explores how people in Toronto get involved in city decisions through yearly surveys by the City Clerk's Office from 2015 to 2023. It looks at various topics like Front Yard Parking, Traffic Calming, Permit Parking Removal, and more, with a special focus on how support for traffic calming and ballot return rates have changed over time. While the community's support for traffic calming has been going up in a positive way, there's an unexpected decrease in the number of returned ballots, making the study more interesting. This paper aims to find out what might be causing this situation, giving insights into how the public engages with city matters and what they prefer.
